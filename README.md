# Image-Classification
Flowers Image Classification (CNN - Keras)

Hello everyone! I hope you are having a nice day!

In this notebook, I will try the process of implementing CNN with Keras in order to classify images.

1. Firstly, we'll import usefull packages.

2. Then, we'll load the data, before visualize and preprocess it.

3. We'll try a simple CNN model and then we will evaluate its performances.

4. We will then use pre trained model to address this challenge as well.


About the dataset:
This dataset contains 7156 images of orchid flowers and consists of 156 orchid species. Most of the images are Flickr images under the Creative Commons license and some of the images are obtained from websites like Go Botany (Native Plant Trust), Encyclopedia of Life (EoL), etc. Different from other flower datasets, besides containing images, this dataset also containing flower's characteristics. The dataset can be used for multi-class classification and also for multi-label classification (2020-06-25)
