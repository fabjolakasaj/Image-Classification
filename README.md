# Image-Classification
Flowers Image Classification (CNN - Keras)

Hello everyone! I hope you are having a nice day!

In this notebook, I will try the process of implementing CNN with Keras in order to classify images.

Firstly, we'll import usefull packages.
Then, we'll load the data, before visualize and preprocess it.
We'll try a simple CNN model and then we will evaluate its performances.
We will then use pre trained model to address this challenge aswell.
