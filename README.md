# Image-Classification
Flowers Image Classification (CNN - Keras)

In this notebook, we will try the process of implementing CNN with Keras in order to classify images.

1. Firstly, we'll import useful packages.

2. Then, we'll load the data, before visualizing and prep-processing it.

3. We'll try a simple CNN model and then we will evaluate its performance.

4. We will then use pre trained model to address this challenge as well.


About the dataset:
This dataset contains 7156 images of orchid flowers and consists of 156 orchid species. Most of the images are Flickr images under the Creative Commons license and some of the images are obtained from websites like Go Botany (Native Plant Trust), Encyclopedia of Life (EoL), etc. Different from other flower datasets, besides containing images, this dataset also containing flower's characteristics. The dataset can be used for multi-class classification and also for multi-label classification (2020-06-25)
